 Hypothesis: History repeats itself periodically.
 
This project is aimed at automating trades assuming history repeats, and similar patterns can be found out historically
which are existent at the present times. If there is enough evidence from the past suggesting shorting or going long is
a good option, we can do that!
Eventual goal is to combine this approach with some momentum-trading strategy to create an ensemble, and then automating
the trades using an external API.
